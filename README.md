It was the 80s... then it was the 90s... then everything went crazy. The data was everywhere, but who would come on top as the ultimate tsar of the search engines!!

  - Your team starts as a mere startup in a garage in the distant year of 1991.
  - Your goal is to figure this new internet thing and make the best of it!
  - Will you be blessed with a good engineering team, business acumen or a boost by an angel investor? Would someone steal your technology? Would you be able to retain your IPs and your people? Only time will show.

# Gameplay - Your team "McSearcher" is established in 1991.

- REPUTATION is highest prized item in the game, with it everything is easier, without it … well let’s just say you want to have it.
- Everything is TECHNOLOGY driven, the better technology you have the faster you can develop new PRODUCTS (search autocomplete, email services to mine for data etc.) and ASSETS (such as data centers, websites hosting, etc.)
- EVENTS and BONUSES are game modifiers that give boosts (an angel investor gives you additional funding) or deter your progress (a market crash results in firing half of your personnel)
